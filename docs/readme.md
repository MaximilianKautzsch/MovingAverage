# MovingAverage Library

The MovingAverage library provides a template class for implementing various types of moving average filters in Arduino projects. It supports Simple Moving Average (SMA), Cumulative Average (CA), Weighted Moving Average (WMA), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) calculations.

Easy to integrate into Arduino projects, this library supports multiple types of moving averages. Both window size and smoothing factor are customizable for different types of averages.

To use this library:

```Arduino
#include <MovingAverage.h>
```

## Installation

1. Download the MovingAverage library ZIP file from the [latest release](https://github.com/maximiliankautzsch/MovingAverage/releases/latest).
2. In the Arduino IDE, navigate to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library`.
3. Select the downloaded ZIP file and click `Open`.
4. The library should now be installed and ready to use.
